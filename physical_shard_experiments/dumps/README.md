Dumps that have been added to the `chopping-block` folder have been deprecated (probably not even benchmarked) because they were either deemed not interesting enough to investigate, or the queries needed
to use them were too hard to benchmark.

For example, `partition_gdpr_reddit.sql` has been added there because it's function signatures
are hard to deal with when doing automated benchmarking.
