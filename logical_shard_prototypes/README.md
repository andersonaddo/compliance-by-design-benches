Reddit clone with logical shards using hstores - complete
Reddit clone with logical shards using jsonb - WIP (strange type error with liking comments

**Note**
When running the reddit_hstore script to recreate the database, make sure that 
you've run `CREATE EXTENSION hstore;` in your target database first.
